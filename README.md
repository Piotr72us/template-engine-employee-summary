## Installation


Download (clone) this repository from github and open it in Visual Studio Code on your machine. Make sure to install the inquirer dependency by typing `npm install inquirer` in your terminal. Finally, type `node app.js` to initiate __The Devs Office Builder!__


## Usage
Follow the prompts displayed in your terminal by the inquirer. First, enter your Manager's contact details. Then, choose how many (if any) Engineers and Interns you would like to add to your team. Enter each of their details and decide if you want to add another role or if you are ready to build your team. Each employee has their name, role, ID, and email displayed on their card. In addition, the Manager has the office number, the Engineer has the github profile, and the Intern has the school name. When you are done answering all the questions, your input will be conveniently displayed on a brand new html page and saved in an output folder inside your local repository. Look at the screenshots to find out more. Good luck!
